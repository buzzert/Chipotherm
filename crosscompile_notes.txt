There seems to be a myriad of different ways described on the web about how to do this. I had the most success so far with debootstrap with QEMU

# mkdir /var/jessie_armhf
# qemu-debootstrap --arch armhf jessie /var/jessie_armhf http://deb.debian.org/debian/

This basically bootstraps an entire debian into /var/jessie_armhf. You should then be able to chroot into it via `chroot /var/jessie_armhf`. You might need to copy the qemu interpreter over first:

# cp /usr/bin/qemu-arm-static /var/jessie_armhf/usr/bin

Then, use /var/jessie_armhf as the sysroot for pkg-config and you should be able to get the right library paths. Use this *in combination* with the cross-compile toolchain on the host machine (arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc)
