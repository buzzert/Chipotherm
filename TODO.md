# Todo
* Cleanup Qube code
    * Don't create a texture every time
    * Maybe look into using [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) instead for matrix multiplications
* Buttons

# Ideas
* Temperature graph would be cool
* Network status panel
* Graph of outside temperature vs inside temperature
* List of cities that match the temperature of XION at the current time
* Time date and uptime


# Stretch ideas
* Laser pointer that sweeps the room and makes it look like it scanning
